# Ansible Automation - Server Configuration

This repository contains Ansible playbooks to manage and automate server configuration tasks.

---

## üõ† Prerequisites

- Ansible installed (>= 2.18)
- Python (>= 3.8) installed on the remote servers
- SSH access to target hosts
- Inventory file (`inventory.ini` or dynamic inventory script)

Install Ansible (Ubuntu):

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ansible -y
```


üìÅ Repository Structure

```bash

.
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ playbook.yml
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ inventory.ini
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ playbook.yml
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md
```

1. Define Your Inventory
Edit the "inventory.ini" file:

```bash

[ec2]
192.168.1.10  ansible_user=ubuntu  ansible_ssh_private_key_file=~/.ssh/id_rsa  ansible_connection=ssh  ansible_user=distronix  ansible_python_interpreter=/usr/bin/python3.8
```
Or use dynamic inventory (e.g., AWS, GCP, etc.).

2. Run the Playbook
Basic syntax:
```bash

ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini playbook.yml -K
```

To run with extra variables:
```bash

ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini playbook.yml -e "env=production"
```

To check without applying changes (dry-run):

```bash

ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini playbook.yml --check
```


üîê SSH Key Setup

Ensure your SSH key is copied to target servers:

```bash

ssh-copy-id user@host
```
Or set up in ~/.ssh/config or inventory.ini.


üß™ Example: Running a Sample Playbook

```bash

ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini check_resources.yml
```
